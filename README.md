# Simple Go REST API

This is a basic example of a Go REST API. It provides endpoints for managing items.

## Prerequisites

- Go installed on your system.
- A terminal for running commands.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd my-golang-api
   ```

2. Build the Go application:

   ```bash
   go build
   ```

3. Run the Go application:

   ```bash
   ./my-golang-api
   ```

The API is now running on port 8080.

## Testing with `curl`

You can use `curl` to test the API. Below are some example `curl` commands to interact with the API:

1. Get all items:

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8080/items
   ```

2. Get a specific item by ID (replace `your_item_id` with an actual ID):

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8080/items/your_item_id
   ```

3. Create a new item:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id":"item1", "name":"New Item"}' http://localhost:8080/items/create
   ```

4. Update an existing item by ID (replace `your_item_id` with an actual ID):

   ```bash
   curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id":"your_item_id", "name":"Updated Item"}' http://localhost:8080/items/update/your_item_id
   ```

Remember to replace `your_item_id` and customize the JSON data as needed for your specific use case.

## Additional Information

- Customize the API endpoints and data structures in the `main.go` file to suit your requirements.
- This is a basic example. In a production environment, you should consider security, error handling, and database integration, among other things.
